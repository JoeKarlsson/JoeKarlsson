### Hi there fellow nerds ðŸ‘‹
<h3 align="left">I am a Developer Advocate and Software Developer at SingleStore</h3>

Joe Karlsson (he/they) is a software engineer turned Developer Advocate. He comes from the frozen tundra of Minneapolis, Minnesota (and yes, it does get really cold here, and no, not everyone here has the accent from the movie, Fargo). Joe has been primarily a Node and JavaScript engineer. He has been writing, teaching, and talking about code his entire career. Sharing what he knows and continuing to learn about programming is truly the thing he loves doing the most.
